# RetroKit

`RetroKit` is a swift package to build emulated platform libraries for the Retro project. 
`RetroKit` aims to provide the building blocks needed for anyone to emulate their favorite retro console, handheld or PC.

`RetroKit` is still early in its development and should be considered in a preview state. Currently `RetroKit` only provides base protocols that need to be implemented.
